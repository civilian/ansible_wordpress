Ansible + Wordpress
==============================

Installing, and managing [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com/) via [Ansible](ansible.cc) on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/server).

Currently only set up to provision on a vagrant install, but I will flesh this out further to install to production, as well as doing migrations from
local development onto other servers.

The example playbooks use the settings I use for my local development. I would suggest changing them as you need.
